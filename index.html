    		http://www.alealimay.com/ has a really cool header/nav bar thing. Currently began working on website/journal. Going to be doing it in a blog style. Here is some progress shots (insert pictures).  having difficulties creating a javascript sticky navigation bar that sticks after a certain point. Also some image links (for page dividers) are not working for some reason. I dont understand javascript. Currently there are too many fonts and its making my brain throw up.

    		this week we were refreshed about github. Then my research group researched bootstrap. We learnt that it is a collection of pre made templates that you can link into your website and customise them. There are mostly a bunch of pre styled rules and they can be used in css.
            Then I worked on my website further, gave it a wrapper and started looking into making it a responsive webpage to that it can be viewed on other screens. </p>

<h1> Week 5</h1>
<h2> Posted April 1 2015 </h2>
        <p>This is week five and our research group was given the task of researching pseudo-classes. We were also introduced to a website called codepen which allows you to put in code and mess about with code. It's super useful and i'll definitely be using it to test seperate elements of code in the future. This was the codepen our group made that displayed some of the uses and types of pseudo-classes. (INSERT IFRAME?) http://codepen.io/anon/pen/MYReoN . Next, we looked at responsive grid system (For css grid codes) and the @media tag. Responsive grid system is a website that allows you to generate code to make a responsive website using grids.
            The @media tag allows different rules to be applied to the same style depending on the media it is displayed on. For example, you could use it to differentiate between media for screen and media for print. multiple classes in the one element.</p>
