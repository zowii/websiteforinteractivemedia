<h1> The Worst Day EVER!!!! </h1>
<h2> 5th March 2013 </h2>
<p> Dear Diary <br> 
	today was like... tHE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE!!. First of all. brad broke up with me. like what the heck?? then he started dating angelina. who does she think she is. Then I broke all my limbs but its whatever cause now all my friends have to carry me around and everyone wants to sign my multiple casts. And to top it all off.. mum brought home milk mnms instead of crispy ones. HOW DOES SHE EXPECT ME TO EAT THESE?<br>
